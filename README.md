# Live-tracking-of-assets
Created a program to track the assets moving on a seaport using GPS and RFID.
• Based on certain conditions specified by the port, created restricted zones. Whenever an asset enters a restricted zone, it is alerted at the port
• The algorithm tracks the assets and alerts the port officials when they enter out of their zone, or when the validation limit is expired.
